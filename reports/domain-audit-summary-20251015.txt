Script Status: FIXED and FUNCTIONAL

========================================

ISSUES FIXED:
✅ Report location moved from /var/log/ to ./reports/
✅ Domain parsing fixed (removed trailing colons)
✅ Domain counting corrected (now shows 681 domains across 258 accounts)
✅ Logging cleanup (eliminated duplicate/mixed log entries)
✅ WHOIS functionality verified and working

SAMPLE AUDIT RESULTS (12 domains processed):
• Active domains: 7 (58%)
• WHOIS failed: 4 (33%)
• Other statuses: 1 (8%)

ACTIVE DOMAINS FOUND:
- seeburgdigital.com (user: centavr)
- beeberrywoods.com (user: beeber)
- bodyforwife.com (user: bodyfor)
- malumaureum.net (user: malum)
- crazyclimber.com (user: ham)
- donnellpond.com (user: dcook)
- lanpherassociates.com (user: lanpher)

WHOIS LOOKUP FAILURES:
- tennysonlove.com (user: tennyson) - possible timeout
- springersgymnasticscenter.com (user: spring) - possible timeout
- zb.svaha.com (user: zb) - subdomain, expected failure
- timnoble.svaha.com (user: timnoble) - subdomain, expected failure

SCRIPT PERFORMANCE:
• Processing rate: ~1 domain every 2 seconds (rate limited)
• Total domains to process: 681
• Estimated full completion time: ~22 minutes
• Success rate from sample: 58% successful WHOIS lookups

NEXT STEPS:
1. Run full audit: ./domain-audit.sh (allow 30+ minutes)
2. Review generated report in ./reports/ directory
3. Check log file for detailed domain-by-domain results
4. Set DRY_RUN=false in config/audit.conf for live operations

NOTES:
- WHOIS failures are normal for subdomains and some TLDs
- Script now properly handles rate limiting and timeouts
- All reports store in script directory as requested
- Logging is clean and readable
